Current issues:
 - 22.04 renamed btrfs-tools to btrfs-progs. Breaks host setup.
 - Remote destop support different.
     - Modified full setup to detect bionic -vs- jammy.
 - Proxy setup. Only direct IP/fqdn works with http_proxy.
     - added disclaimer. Not sure if solution practical.
 - Password copy does not work 22 -> 18
     - Punted and prompt for password

Cleanup :

# Should not be needed with systemd-networkd working.
cp /etc/resolv.conf rootfs/run/resolvconf/resolv.conf


# stuff installed

# For efficient use need to point at local apt proxy.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Apt-Cacher%20NG#Client_setup
Only direct mode is working.  NOTE: below doesnt work due to quotes.
use fqdn or ip.
echo 'Acquire::http { Proxy "http://${proxy_server}:3142"; }' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy

Bionic had flaky xrdp.  Had to use vnc/mate.
# after host install required two changes:
sudo usermod -a -G ssl-cert xrdp
echo "mate-session" > ~/.xsession

and a couple reboots.
also
vncpasswd
After starting remote desktop session
vncpasswd -f ~/.vnc/sesman_devvm_passwd\:10

Jammy (22.04) Has a fully working xrdp so vnc and mate
no longer required.  For use from windows host with clipboard
support it is easier to just use remote desktop.

sudo usermod -a -G ssl-cert xrdp
cat << EOF > ~/.xsessionrc
export GNOME_SHELL_SESSION_MODE=ubuntu
export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=ubuntu:GNOME
export XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/etc/xdg/xdg-ubuntu:/etc/xdg
EOF
systemctl restart xrdp

BIG NOTE:  ONLY WORKS IF USER IS NOT LOGGED IN ON CONSOLE.  To
stop:
systemctl set-default multi-user.target

Mounting encrypted volume from syno.  Requires copy or RW snapshot.
mount -t ecryptfs -o ecryptfs_cipher=aes,ecryptfs_key_bytes=32,ecryptfs_passthrough=no



# Live image generation.
Urgh what a PITA for such a simple thing.  There are only really a few
things required:

1) An ISO image generated with options to be bootable -- either ISOLINUX
el-torito or grub-EFI support.  ( Or both aka hybrid ).

2) Config files for above e.g. live-compatible grub.conf and/or
extlinux.conf ( usb ), isolinux.cfg ( ISO ).

3) An initrd capable of making the read-only root appear as RW by performing
a union mount with either ram or user specified persistent media.

If you wonder why it is being done the way it is instead of fancy tool "X"
see history of this file.  Probably been tried and failed.
