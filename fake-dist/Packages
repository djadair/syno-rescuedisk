Description: multiple repository bootstrap based on apt
 A debootstrap replacement with multiple repository support,
 using apt to handle all dependency issues and conflicts.
 .
 Multistrap includes support for native and foreign architecture
 bootstrap environments. Foreign bootstraps only need minimal
 configuration on the final device. Also supports cleaning up the
 generated bootstrap filesystem to remove downloaded packages and
 hooks to modify the files in the bootstrap filesystem after the
 packages have been unpacked but before being configured.
 .
 Unlike debootstrap, multistrap relies on working versions of
 dpkg and apt outside the final filesystem. If dpkg supports
 MultiArch, foreign architecture libraries can be installed,
 where available.
